[verse]
I’ve been holding on to a feeling
Chasing daylight through the night
Searching for the spark inside me
Ready now to shine so bright

[chorus]
Let the rhythm lift my heartbeat
Let the melody ignite my soul
Every step a brand-new story
I’m unstoppable, I’m in control

[bridge]
I recall the doubts and questions
Tangled deep inside my mind
But each note breaks through the shadows
Revealing hope I long to find

[chorus]
Let the rhythm lift my heartbeat
Let the melody ignite my soul
Every step a brand-new story
I’m unstoppable, I’m in control

[outro]
And as the music fades away
I carry forward with a smile
Because I know this song within
Makes every struggle worthwhile
